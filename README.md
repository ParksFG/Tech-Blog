## Description

This project is a social media where people can write posts and essentially make their own little blogs.  You can chat with other tech enthusiasts about any tech related things.  This website features a userbase, creating posts, commenting on posts, editing, and deleting posts.  I made this project to practice using sequelize, mysql, and handlebars.  One of the best things I learned from this project was how much I like handlebars for easily dynamically generating webpages.
